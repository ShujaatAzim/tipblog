This is the repo I used to re-build my tip app for blogging/tutorial purposes!

All you have to do in order to follow the blog is open it, or pull it and open in your own code editing program! Just be sure to run `npm install` to get all the packages after you have copied it.

1) Pull down the repo.
2) Open it in your favorite code editing program.
3) Run `npm install` after opening.
4) Run `npm start` to open it in your browser.
